This can make the Recycle Bin Settings and Shares pages more responsive and prevent disk spinups when accessing the Recycle Bin.  The Recycle Bin size can take up to a minute to refresh when this is enabled.

:recycle_bin_ud_plug:
> Set to 'Yes' to enable the Recycle Bin deleted file functionality on Unassigned Devices drive shares when the Unassigned Devices plugin is installed.  SMB/NFS mounts and iso mounts are excluded from the Recycle Bin functionality on this server.  Enable the Recycle Bin on the remote server where the remote share originates if it is an Unraid server.

> Enter the parameters in a list with no spaces or commas between them.
> The order of the parameters will affect the file structure in the Recycle Bin.
> Leaving this field blank will put all deleted files in the Recycle Bin without any path information.
>
> Hint: Use the '/' for more control of the directory structure in the Recycle Bin.
> For example '%m/%S' will organize the deleted files by the machine name that deleted the file and then the share name structure.
>
> + '%S' Samba share name (which in Unraid equals the share name), eg. Storage
> + '%P' User share full path, eg /mnt/user/Storage, /mnt/disk1, /mnt/disks/unassigned_device, /flash
> + '%u' Username of the current service, if any
> + '%m' Machine name of the user who deleted the file

>
> For example: 'Squidbait' (without quotes) will exclude all shares created by the Ransom Ware plugin.

> Note: Excluding a share only excludes it from deleted files going to the .Recycle.Bin folder on the share.  Files in the existing .Recycle.Bin folder will still show in the total size and on the 'Shares' tab.
