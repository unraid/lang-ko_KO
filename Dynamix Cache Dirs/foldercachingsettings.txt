:cachedirs_info_plug:
> Folder Caching Info
>
> The folder caching (cache_dirs) reads directories continously to keep them in memory.
> The program does not know whether a directory is already in memory or need to be reread from disk.
> Therefore it cannot avoid spinning up disks when it happens that the linux memory cache evicts a directory and cache_dirs rescans the directoy.
> If a large number of files are being kept in memory then it seems inevitably that some diretories get evicted from the cache when the system is under load.
>
> The program by default uses an adaptive mode where it reduces the depth of the directory structure which it tries to keep in memory.
> When it detects a cache-miss (slow scan time) it will reduce the depth until disks are idle again,
> but will still be at risk of putting load on the disks for a minute or two until the program gives up and waits for idle disks.
> The less files the cache needs to hold, the less likely it is that the program spins up disks.

:cachedirs_function_plug:
> Select whether folder caching is enabled or disabled. Caching will only effectively occur when the array is started.

:cachedirs_pressure_plug:
> Set cache_pressure to NN (default = 10). A value of 0 means never reclaim cache.
>
> A value of 1 works great for many users. If your disks spin up or cache_dirs logging indicates it frequently has accessed disks after scan, try lowering cache-pressure to 1. If the system runs out of memory increase cache-pressure.
>
> If CPU and disks is heavily affected by cache_dirs on frequent intervals this is also an indication that cache_dirs has to rescan everything.
>
> Warning: a value of 0 will cause kernel never to release the memory of directories, and if too little memory is available,
> it will cause the system to crash. cache_dirs does not reset the cachePressure after quitting,
> to reset the cache-pressure execute 'sudo sysctl vm.vfs_cache_pressure=100', or run cache-dirs with cache_pressure 100.
>
> See 'vfs_cache_pressure' in [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt).
